🚀 Operation Guide

Follow these simple steps to start using SLID.

1. Run Ngrok (or another tunneling tool)

If you are using SLID via the web or need to expose it externally, you must run a tunneling service (like Ngrok) to route traffic to the application's local port.

Important Note: Ngrok must be run on the following port:

ngrok http 8080


2. Run the SLID Tool

Now, launch the main application file using Python 3:

python3 app.py


Accessing the Interface: You can access the SLID interface via the link provided by Ngrok after it starts running.
